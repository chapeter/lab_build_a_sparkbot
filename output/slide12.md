## Restarting Stopped Container 

If you exit out of the container before completing the lab and want to continue from where you left off, do not execute a `docker run` command again.  This will create a new clean container that lacks any of your work.  Instead follow the below to start the original container.

```
# Verify that you have  a container in a stopped state
docker ps -a

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
cf95a414877e        hpreston/devbox:latest        "/bin/bash"         2 minutes ago       Exited (0) 10 seconds ago                         botlab

# Restart your stopped container
docker start -i botlab
