## Windows Users: Running in Sample Container

If your workstation is Windows based, you can run the lab exercises from within a Docker container.  

***You could also run within a Linux Virtual Machine that has the required tools installed and working.  If you choose to use that method, you will need to have a VM already available and ready to use.***
